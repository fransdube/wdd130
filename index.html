            My name is MF Dube, and I am a dedicated data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights from complex data sets. Currently, I work at AM Logistics, where I apply my analytical skills to improve business operations and drive strategic decision-making. With a strong background in data analysis, I specialize in using statistical methods and data visualization techniques to translate data into actionable strategies.

            Beyond my professional life, I am continuously learning and staying updated with the latest trends in data analytics. My goal is to leverage data to solve real-world problems and contribute to the success of my team and organization. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal data projects, and reading about advancements in the field. 

            I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others to turn data into meaningful insights, and I am always eager to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.
